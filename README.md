# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this study guide for referencing during lessons so I used my own vocabulary as much as possible. By using my "own words" allowed me to understand the concepts better. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

I needed to download and install Github and Vs Code which are both free. Terminal was already installed on my MacBook which saved a some time.
